# Pritesh-Arts

Welcome to **Pritesh-Arts**! I’m Pritesh, a 16-year-old artist specializing in pencil sketches.

## About

Art has always been my passion, and I focus on creating detailed, expressive drawings. My work often involves simpler subjects, which I bring to life with intricate shading and careful attention to detail. I typically spend around two days on each piece to ensure that every aspect of my artwork reflects my vision. Currently, I am excited to share my ongoing project—a story series featuring Baby Krishna. Follow along to see how it unfolds!
